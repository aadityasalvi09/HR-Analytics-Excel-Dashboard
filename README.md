## 📌 Project Overview

This HR Analytics Dashboard was built to help organisations move beyond surface-level headcount reports and truly understand their workforce. Using a real-world HR dataset of 1,470 employees, the dashboard analyses key metrics spanning hiring trends, salary distribution, attrition patterns, employee satisfaction, education levels, and work-life balance.

Every visual was designed with a decision-maker in mind, turning complex data into a clear, skimmable story.
